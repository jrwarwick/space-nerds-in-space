/***************************************************

  We need to have some kind of list of callbacks that we can add to,
  then later scan from another thread.  This is because you can only call
  lua functions from the thread which created the lua state.  If other
  threads would like to call lua, they need to schedule their callbacks
  so the main thread can run them.

  How this is meant to be used:
  There are two opaque types:

	struct event_callback_entry;
	sturct callback_schedule_entry;

  event_callback_entry associates a type of "event", which has a name (a string)
  with a small list of callbacks (current max is 3 callbacks per event.)
  The event_callback_entry forms a linked list of such entries.  So if you get an
  event, you can figure out what callbacks need to be done by looking through a
  list of event_callback_entries.

  The callback_schedule_entry contains the name of a callback, how many params
  and the values of those params.  It is a linked list of callbacks that should
  be made.

  So, you can do this to add a callback entry to the schedule "my_schedule" to call
  "my_callback" with params 1.0, 2.0, 3.0:

  struct callback_schedule_entry *my_schedule = NULL;
  schedule_one_callback(&my_schedule, "my_callback", 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0);
